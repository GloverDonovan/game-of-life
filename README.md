### Data Model & Game Mechanics

- Set up a grid with black and white squares
- 4 rules:
  1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies (underpopulated)
  2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on
  3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies (overpopulated)
  4. A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes live itself (reproduction)

- Checkboxes are used instead of canvas because the functionality is already built-in.
- Begin with implementing the logic so that it works in the console, then focus on the interface to drive that code.
